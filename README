                   Evil Language Compiler
                              by
                Marcus Ortiz and Jeffrey Good
============================================================

1. Run make to build the compiler
2. Compile using "evil <source file>"
3. Run executable, which has the same name as the file (created in current working directory of step 2)
     e.g. "evil benchmarks/mixed/mixed.ev" will create an exectuable named "mixed"
